# Elm project
I build this project as a learning project to learn Elm.
I am more than happy for any reviews or ideas where and how to improve.

## What is it doing
magic stuff (more to come...)

## Getting started

### Installation
You need to have [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 0.18 installed on your machine.

If you have yarn installed (you should) you can just run

    yarn run installation


**Otherwise do the following:**

Install JS dependencies with:

    [yarn|npm] install

Install Elm dependencies with:

    elm package install


### Running
Start webpack-dev-server (recompiles when files change)

    [yarn|npm] run start   

Then view it:

    localhost:8080
